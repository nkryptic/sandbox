      # OTHER WAYS
      # ====
      # ONLY WORKS FOR BASH
      # if [[ "$BASH_SOURCE" == "$0" ]]
      # then
      #    echo "script was executed, not sourced"
      # fi
      # ====
      # COULD WORK FOR BASH:
      # if [ -n `readlink -f $0` ]; then
      #    echo "script was executed, not sourced"
      # fi
